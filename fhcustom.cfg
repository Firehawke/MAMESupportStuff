				By default, map XBox-style controls first. Whatever's left can go to DInput-style controls as needed.

				This simplifies actual controller mapping quite a bit. If I decide later that I'd like to set up specific alternative DInput controllers in a static way, I can
				go back and add additional joycode lines above mapping to the VID/PID of the given pad.

				Razer Blackwidow Chroma Keyboard, always slot 1
				
				By default the sheer number of extra keyboard-emulating devices I have hooked up (e.g. Saitek flight stick) can easily push my real keyboard out of slot #1.
				
				This results in MAME not allowing me to use the default maps to get into the menus and do much of anything with multiple keyboards turned on. 
				So, this line is used to force my actual keyboard to ALWAYS be in the proper slot.

			<!--
				Razer Tartarus Chroma running custom key mapping, always keyboard slot 2

				Mapping in Synapse is to keyboard keys:
				QWERT
				ASDFG    plus arrows, Y above dpad, space below.
				ZXCVB

				This combined with multiple keyboard mode in MAME allows me to map whatever I choose to the Tartarus controls.

				I use it for unusual controls that wouldn't normally be on an arcade stick; e.g. game selection on NeoGeo and the whole stack of extra control panel 
				buttons on PlayChoice-10.
